## The "colonialisation" of OSM

* OSM describes perfectly the reality in the UK -> not strightforward to adapt to other realities
  * Geography: Global South
  * Demography: "Minorities"
* `amenity=brothel` objects: 2,801 vs `amenity=breastfeeding` objects: 0

---

## The Maps of the excluded

* What values are embedded in current maps? What societies are perpetuating current maps? (heteronormativity, global north)
* How are/should be the maps for the so-called "minorities"? How could we create them? Why are they needed?
  * Disabled, children, LGTBI+, BAME, Global South (SDG 10)
  * Women (SDG 5)
  * ...

This could be connected to:

* SDG 5: gender equality
* SDG 10: reduced inequalities

And not so directly related to:

* SDG 11: sustainable cities and communities

## "Urbanising" the SDG

* Hard question: _How can we achieve SDG?_
  * Who is responsible for that? 
  * What's the scale for achieving
* Recognized Importance of cities 
  * Institutional answer: New Urban Agenda (UN 2017)
  * Grassroots?
* Urbanisation's impacts on SDG

SDG are undeniable. However, they pose a difficult question:

If we understand urbansation as the materialisation of values and policies in the built environment, which shape the space that influences how we live, how we work... it makes much sense to shape the built environment according to SDG.
