## Accessible Zaragoza 

{{% note %}}

‚ÄúAccessible Zaragoza‚Äù, an **action-research** project on urban mobility which I designed and led while **working as a lecturer** at Universidad San Jorge in Spain.

## The problem(s)

People with disabilities cannot be fully autonomous when moving within a city <br> <small>(especially in a foreign city).</small>

{{% fragment %}}
Facing several types of exclusion, i.e.:

* **Physical**: urban design
* **Technological**: (lack of) specialized apps/services

{{% note %}}

The problem we wanted to address was that people with...

This is because people with disabilities have to face with multiple types of exclusion that include **social barriers**, **Signs/symbols**, **regulations**/other people's **behaviour** etc? 

But we wanted to address two types of exclusion. (NEXT) 

A physical one, due to urban design and a technological one, due to lack of specific apps and services

## Our Goal

<!-- ![](img/esquema-colores.png) -->

The creation of a **pilot** to overcome those 2 problems.

* Map capable of:
  * Assessing Zaragoza in terms of accessibility
  * Providing routing calculations for disabled people in order to improve their autonomy
* Test a protocol/methodology

{{% note %}}

Our goal, then, was to create a pilot to overcome those 2 problems.

That should include a map and also test a protocol methodology.

This led us to take the following research decisions:

Research Design Decision 1:

## Open and collaborative project

{{% note %}}

We would be using OpenStreetMap

* Political decision
  * Results should be used and shared by anyone if they are to be of any use
  * Citizenship has to be part of it
* Pragmatic decision
  * Overcome our own limitations (staff, infrastructure, budget)
  * Reduce setup time

Research Design Decision 2:

## Teaming up with others

To overcome individual limitations and get better results.

Our second research design was to team up with others to overcome our own limitations and get better results.

### Associations/Activists:

Expert knowledge about disabilities.

- Discapacitados Sin Fronteras (NGO)
- Mundo Crip (Association)
- Ganchillo Social (Association)

{{% note %}}
We also teamed up with disability associations and activists. It is important to note that their role was that of experts in their field.

We wanted people to see them as experts to learn from, not as someone to pity, which sadly is quite commonplace in these kind of projects.

The third group of stakeholders was made by civic centers and city council, which provided phsyiscal space for gathering, computers, newsletters and mailing lists.

Research Design Decision 3:

## Type of data

Decide what kind of data do we gather

{{% note %}}

This is the type of data that we were gathering. As oposed to similar maps centered in problems, we decided to describe it as objectively as possible.

## Data gathering methods

* Field work
* 2 different types:
  * Staff
  * Mapping parties


{{< note >}}
Since, unfortunately, the data we were looking for did not exist in official sources, we had to gather it by ourselves through field work.

We used twwo different methods of fieldwork

The second mechanism was through mapping parties.

Mapping parties may be the most innovative part of the project. They consisted

{{< slide template="bg-dark" background-image="/img/zaccesible/laura-moya-teaching.jpg" background-opacity="0.8">}}

### 1. Theoretical sessions on disabilities

* Examples
* Discussion about urban design

* Creation of groups and areas to cover. 
  * OSM expert (Stakeholder)
  * Disabilities expert (stakeholder)
  * Student
  * Volunteer

### Leave room for the experts

Disabled people are the experts here, not tokens.

{{% note %}}

We (and specially myself) learnt plenty of things about their problems that enriched the project

* Not possible to speak about "disabilities" in general
* Different disabilities, different needs (sometimes coliding)
* That they could not see the map we were doing!

{{% /note %}}

### Mapping parties

* Right balance of formative and fun
  * Raising awareness
  * Data gathering

Everybody left mapping parties with something (knowledge, satisfaction, contacts...)

### Accessible base maps

Informed by literature review (Allan et¬†al., 2019; Jenny & Kelso, 2007; Russell-Minda et¬†al., 2007)

**Protanopia and Deuteranopia**

{{% note %}}

We made two different of accessible maps, aimed to different color blindness:

* Combination red-yellow-green soft-blue allows them an adequate and understandable visualization.
* Font that improves readibility -> typeface designed by American Printing House for the Blind, inc.

### Integrating teaching and research

* Attendance to mapping parties was compulsory for students from [Universidad San Jorge](https://usj.es)
* Part of the Urban Studies' *curricula*, which covered:
  - Social implications of urban design
  - Digital Tools (GIS, OpenStreetMap, querying databases...)

### Raising awareness

{{% note %}}

As you can imagine, a group like that, with people in wheelchairs, cranes and others with yellow vests attracts a lot of attention. 

A lot of people was interested by our work.

Just as an example: this is the total of attendees of the first mapping parties.

But not everything is about attendance. This oen for example was not organized by us in first instance. We were contacted by this organization who wanted to do a mapping party on their neighbourhood. This means that people started to feel the project as their own!

## Failures üëé

Because not everything is perfect

---

{{< slide background-image="/img/zaccesible/transport-a-b.png" background-opacity="0.2" background-size="contain">}}

### No routing

We failed in our initial goal

{{< slide background-iframe="https://ccamara.carto.com/viz/a11856af-f34f-4862-9607-0486ac106fa6/embed_map" >}}

### Humble visualization

2 online maps, for two groups of disabilities:
1. sight
2. mobility

Not really useful.

{{% note %}}
However, we realised that these types of maps could not be seen by an important group of people to whom we were supposed to wok for: visually impaired people.
{{% /note %}}

### No way to assess impacts

* Information in OSM:
  * Number of changesets?
  * Number of contributors?
* Are changes in regulations related to our work?

### Lack of papers 

#### (Yet?)

<div class="fragment">
...But other types of publications

* Scholarly publications (2)
* Master theses (2)
* ~~Ongoing article~~
 
</div>

More action than research

---

### Weak network

* Artificially created
* We could not work together (failed paper)

---

### Lack of funding

* (almost) No staff
  * Volunteering
* Lack of experience
