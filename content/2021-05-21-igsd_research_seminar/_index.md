## Motivation

* I feel I'm in an important turning point of my life + mid-life crisis
  * Fresh start in the UK
  * Want to consolidate (long-term and seniority)
  * Keep a balanced life: job + interest + personal life
* Right time and place
  * End of contract
  * End of projects -> New projects
  * IGSD is the right place to be (and grow)! ðŸ¥°

## But... 

* I don't know what to do next (Analysis paralysis)
  * Being transdisciplinar is great, but there is no predefined path
  * I've been involved in things that interest me, but I'm not an expert (data viz, data science, disabilities...) -> Impostor syndrome ðŸ¤¥
  * Unsustainable way of life: I need to live according to my values and I haven't found the balance with values and job

* I see we have many things in common but I do not know how to make the best of it + other things that I love from IGSD:
  * Transdisciplinar + collaborative research
  * Impact-oriented research
  * Theory of change + Critical pedagogy
