I have designed this session trying to address your request + showcase some things I've done.
Given the time I'm given this is an introductory session which aims to give an overview of Research tools and learn by example.

## Learning outcomes

1. **Know** what research tools are and why/when are they useful
2. **Identify** types of research tools
3. **Familiarise** with a real case of research tool and its creation process
5. **Familiarise** with some technical concepts (`git`...)
4. **Outline** a possible course of action for developing your research tool

# What?

What is a research software?

{{% note %}}
Something that sits halfway between 

* Research instrument ( microscope )
* Software used in research (Reference manager, Word processors, QAQDAS) (software for general purpose, used by scientists)
* Research tool/software tailored to our needs. Typically does one thing that its crucial for us, and does it well (and in an automated way).

# Why?

Why do we need research tools?

---

Short answer: 

### Research tools make science reproducible

## Philosophical: 

Embedded in science's core values: 
  
* Transparent, 
* Traceable, 
* Useful

{{% note %}}

* others (or ourselves!) should be able to validate/refute it, detect possible errors or limitations, extend it, improve it, adapt it
* ultimately, It should be used for building upon that new knowledge

{{% /note %}}

---

## Practical:

* Reduces time and errors
* Enables **adapting** it to other contexts <small>(same methods, different data; different methods, same data)</small>
* Enables **collaboration**
* Code reuse & sharing **accelerates scientific progress**
* Increasingly required by journals
* Higher **publication impact** (citations, future collaborations, etc)

### Is it for me?

{{% fragment %}} Definitely! Your research will benefit from it + you do not need to be a coding expert (although it helps + you will become one){{% /fragment %}}

{{% note %}}
There are many different types of research tools, some of which do not require you coding skills
