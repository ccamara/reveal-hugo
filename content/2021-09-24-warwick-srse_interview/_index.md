I have designed this session as an introduction to research tools.

Also, since it is my understanding that CIM students may have very different programming knowledge,

It has two parts: 
1. an introductory part where no prior knowledge is required 
2. 2nd part aimed to learn by example which provides a more technical overview. 

Due to time constraints I won't be able to further develop it, but each topic could be developed in one or more sessions. 

I hope it has the right balance of skillsets.

## Learning outcomes

At the end of this session you will...

1. **Know** what research tools are and why/when are they useful
2. **Identify** types of research tools
3. **Familiarise** with a real case of research tool and its creation process
5. **Familiarise** with some technical concepts (`git`...)
4. **Outline** a possible course of action for developing your research tool

# What?

What is a research tool?

Something that sits halfway between 

* Research instrument ( microscope )
* Software used in research (Reference manager, Word processors, QAQDAS) (software for general purpose, used by scientists)
* Research tool/software tailored to our needs. Typically does one thing that its crucial for us, and does it well (and in an automated way).

# Why?

Why do we need research tools?

---

Short answer: 

### Research tools make science reproducible

Why do we want science to be reproducible?

## Philosophical: 

Embedded in science's core values: 
  
* Transparent
* Traceable 
* Replicable
* Useful

{{% note %}}

* others (or ourselves!) should be able to validate/refute it, detect possible errors or limitations, extend it, improve it, adapt it
* ultimately, It should be used for building upon that new knowledge

{{% /note %}}

---

## Practical:

* Reduces time and errors
* Enables **adapting** it to other contexts <small>(same methods, different data; different methods, same data)</small>
* Enables **collaboration**
* Code reuse & sharing **accelerates scientific progress**
* Increasingly required by journals
* Higher **publication impact** (citations, future collaborations, etc)

<small>I'm a student of Digital Media and Culture, not an experienced researcher in Urban Analytics...</small>

### Is it for me?

{{% fragment %}} Definitely! It doesn't depend on: 

* Your research expertise/level
    * Student <-> Senior researcher
* Your background or field of knowledge
    * Digital media, Urban analytics...
* Your coding skills (but you'll learn by doign)

**Either way, your research will benefit from it.**

At this point, you may be wondering if this is something useful for a student of digital media and culture or is something for more experienced researchers in urban analyitcs.
