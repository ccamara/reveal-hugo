## Background (2016)

* We had finished Social Map Risk (2013-2015)
* Sponsorship by Bantierra and Fundación Adecco (from 2010 to 2016) aimed to promote action research projects regarding disabilities.
  - Focused at building level

---

1. Extending the research to **urban scale**
  1. From buildings to cities
2. Link the project with prior research on (social) **exclusion and urban morphology**
  1. Right to the city (Lefebvre, 168; Harvey 2008)
  2. Spatial Justice (Soja, 2010)
