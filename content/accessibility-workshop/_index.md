## Background (2016)

* We had finished Social Map Risk (2013-2015)
* Sponsorship by Bantierra and Fundación Adecco (from 2010 to 2016) aimed to promote action research projects regarding disabilities.
  - Focused at building level

---

1. Extending the research to **urban scale**
  1. From buildings to cities
2. Focusing on Service-Learning dimension
2. Connecting (unconciously) with our prior research on (social) **exclusion and urban morphology**.

## The problem(s)

People with disabilities cannot be fully auonomous when moving in a city (especially in an unknown city). Two types of exclusion:

* Physical: urban design
* Technological: specialized apps/services

## Our Goal

<!-- ![](img/esquema-colores.png) -->

The creation of a **pilot**

* Map capable of:
  - Assessing Zaragoza in terms of accessibility
  - Providing routing calculations for disabled people in order to improve their authonomy
- Test a protocol/methodology

---
## Our Principles

---

{{% section %}}

## Open and collaborative project

---

### Political decision:
  - Results should be used and shared by anyone if they are to be of any use
  - Citizenship has to be part of it

---

### Pragmatical decision:
  - Overcome our own limitations (staff, infrastructure)
  - Reduce setup time

---

## Open/Collaborative

* Political/pragmatical decision
