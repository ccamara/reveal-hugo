Before the counter starts I want to make a disclaimer: Explain assignment and notable differences on study plans between Spain and UK.
I made the following assumptions:
<ul>
<li>First day of first module on BIM.
<ul>
<li>There will be other modules that will provide advanced knowledge</li>
<li>Course content is just a sample. It is likely to be adjusted according to course duration, amongst other issues.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Students do not have prior knowledge about BIM, but they do on Construction
<ul>
<li>Relatively reduced number of students</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

### **B**uilding **I**nformation **M**odelling
<small>(concept from 1970 and further developed in 1987)</small>

<ul><li>We are actually building a (virtual) building beforehand → simmulation of construction process.</li>
  <ul class="fragment"><li>We can extract documentation from it (plans, sections, schedules...)</li>
  <li>We can foresee problems before is too late (always better to fix a line than a wall)</li>
  <li>Everything is connected: a single change, affects all the model (butterfly effect)</li></ul>
</ul>

I know, you might be dissapointed. What makes BIM so revolutionary?

Ask students if they can think of any advantage of this revolutionary approach.

### Information is key.

It allows unprecedent possibilities:

* Project's consistency → error reduction
* Integrated reports and schedules
* Supervision

Everything is possible because of different types of information stored in a relational database within the model.

## What is not BIM

* Not a specific software, but a "family" of different softwares (Archicad, Revit, Allplan, Freecad, Vector Works...).
* Not (just) a design tool
* Not (just) a 3D modelling tool

### This is not a recipes' module:


---

### This is not a module about how to use specific software
(usually tied to two brands)

- The tools that are used the most differ depending on time and region
- Universities are places to learn, not produce consumers
- I don't get any profit if you buy certain software or not
