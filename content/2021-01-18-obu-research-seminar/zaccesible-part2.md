## Accessible Zaragoza

After this interval, let's go back to where we were. I was explaining about the research decisions driving Accessible Zaragoza.

Research Design Decision 2:

## Teaming up with others

To overcome individual limitations and get better results.

{{% note %}}
Our second research design was to team up with others to overcome our own limitations and get better results.

### Associations/Activists:

Expert knowledge about disabilities.

- Discapacitados Sin Fronteras (NGO)
- Mundo Crip (Association)
- Ganchillo Social (Association)

{{% note %}}
We also teamed up with disability associations and activists. It is important to note that their role was that of experts in their field.

We wanted people to see them as experts to learn from, not as someone to pity, which sadly is quite commonplace in these kind of projects.

### Public Administration:

Physical space for gathering, computers, mailing...

- Civic Centers
- City council (Zaragoza Activa)

{{% note %}}

The third group of stakeholders was made by civic centers and city council, which provided phsyiscal space for gathering, computers, newsletters and mailing lists.

Research Design Decision 3:

## Type of data

Decide what kind of data do we gather

{{% note %}}
At this point, it was clear that we wanted to map problems like these ones. However, we were to decide what kind of data were we going to need.

We took two important decisions:
{{% /note %}}

## Target

We would (only) focus on:

1. Visual impariment
2. Mobility impairment

{{% note %}}
Ackowledge that there are different types of disabilities and each has it's own needs. We could not cover all of them.

{{< slide template="bg-dark" background-image="/img/zaccesible/etiquetas-en-uso.png" background-opacity="0.6">}}

### Be objective

{{% note %}}
We would describe reality as objectively as possible. E.g. We would describe if there is a tactile_paving, the existence of traffic lights with accouistic signals, the existence of kerbs (And if so, we would note their height), the width of pavement, it's incline and smoothness... the presence of ramps, stairs...

## Data Gathering and Publishing

{{%  note %}}
Once those deicions were made we only need to gather data and the publish it so others can share it.
Simple, right? Well... not really.

## Data gathering methods

* Field work
* 2 different types:
  * Staff
  * Mapping parties


{{< note >}}
Since, unfortunately, the data we were looking for did not exist in official sources, we had to gather it by ourselves through field work.

We used twwo different methods of fieldwork

### 1. Fieldwork made by research assistants (USJ)

The most conventional way to get the data was through the fieldwork made by research assistants as part of their job description.

The second mechanism was through mapping parties.

Mapping parties may be the most innovative part of the project. They consisted

### 1. Theoretical sessions on disabilities

* Common problems
* Examples
* Discussion about urban design

* Creation of groups and areas to cover. 
  * OSM expert (Stakeholder)
  * Disabilities expert (stakeholder)
  * Student
  * Volunteer

You'd be surprised about how rudimentary (yet efficient) our methods were.

Through a series of iterations we ended up with the following method:

## Visualization

2 online maps, for two groups of disabilities:
1. sight
2. mobility

{{% note %}}
However, we realised that these types of maps could not be seen by an important group of people to whom we were supposed to wok for: visually impaired people.

### Accessible base maps

Informed by literature review (Allan et al., 2019; Jenny & Kelso, 2007; Russell-Minda et al., 2007)

**Protanopia and Deuteranopia**

{{% note %}}

We made two different of accessible maps, aimed to different color blindness:

* Combination red-yellow-green soft-blue allows them an adequate and understandable visualization.
* Font that improves readibility -> typeface designed by American Printing House for the Blind, inc.

### Integrating teaching and research

* Attendance to mapping parties was compulsory for students from [Universidad San Jorge](https://usj.es)
* Part of the Urban Studies' *curricula*, which covered:
  - Social implications of urban design
  - Digital Tools (GIS, querying databases...)

## Raising awareness

{{% note %}}

As you can imagine, a group like that, with people in wheelchairs, cranes and others with yellow vests attracts a lot of attention. 

A lot of people was interested by our work.

But not everything is about attendance. This oen for example was not organized by us in first instance. We were contacted by this organization who wanted to do a mapping party on their neighbourhood. This means that people started to feel the project as their own!
