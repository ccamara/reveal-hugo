description = "Oxford Brookes University, School of the Built Environment Research Seminar: In this seminar I will present two research projects that share a crowdsourced approach: Accessible Zaragoza and Post-Pandemic Equitable and Sustainable Transport. Accessible Zaragoza is an action-research project of collaborative mapping about urban accessibility in the city of Zaragoza (Spain) I led while I was lecturing at the School of Architecture and Technology at San Jorge University. Accessible Zaragoza was aimed to create a collaborative online map that contributes to increase the autonomy of people with functional diversity and hence, their social integration and living standards.PEST Project is the project led by Tim Jones and Ben Spencer at Brookes which aims to coproduce an indicators matrix to increase understanding of place-based policy and activity in relation to active travel in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic"
