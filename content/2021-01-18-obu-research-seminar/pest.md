Just to give you an idea of the scale of the project, we are preparing visualizations such as this treemap, which displays how much has been allocated in different areas.

1. To **understand and map** *what types of schemes* are proposed and *where*.

## Gathering intelligence about ATF

{{% note %}}

We will be using three different sources of data gathering

{{% /section %}}

---

### ATF tracking

* data **request to DfT** to obtain intelligence on the schemes that were awarded funds
* **online form** targeted at local authorities who are in receipt of ATF
* data provided by our **stakeholders**

{{% note %}}

The first one will consist of asking authorities about the schemes that were awarded funds. We will be do so, through:

1. a data request to DfT (Department For Transport)
2. Online form targeted at local authorities
3. data provided by our stakeholders
