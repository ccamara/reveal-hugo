## Slides for presentations and talks

This repo contains a series of slides I have been creating for several presentations and talks. Slides are created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) using [Reveal-hugo theme](reveal-hugo.dzello.com/) and are deployed using Netlify. Results can be seen at https://slides.carloscamara.es
